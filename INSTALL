This program depends on the OpenSSL library (http://www.openssl.org/).

Unix or GNU/Linux
=================

Run

$ ./configure 

followed by

$ make

The "crackxls2003" executable will be created in the build directory.

A choice of implementation algorithms may be chosen using the --with-algo
argument to configure. Most of these are experimental and not all the
necessary files are included with the distributed crackxls2003 source.

Windows
=======

crackxls2003 compiles under Cygwin. For a standalone executable which doesn't
depend on the Cygwin runtime you will have to install the OpenSSL library and
not use the Cygwin version. For convenience, a (not-necessarily up-to-date)
Windows executable is included with the source.
